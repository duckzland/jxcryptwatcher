export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
```

Then refresh your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### 4. Build the application

Run the provided build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will:
- Download all required Go modules
- Compile the app
- Generate the `jxcryptwatcher` executable

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The app requires three configuration files for normal operation:

- `config.json`
- `panels.json`
- `cryptos.json`

These files are automatically generated on first launch and saved to:

```
~/jxcryptwatcher/config.json
~/jxcryptwatcher/panels.json
~/jxcryptwatcher/cryptos.json
```

### üìÅ Example Configurations

You can find sample configuration files in the `examples/` directory:

```
examples/config_example.json
examples/panels_example.json
```

### üîÑ Refreshing Crypto Data

The `cryptos.json` file is auto-generated using data from CoinMarketCap.  
To refresh the list of available cryptocurrencies, simply delete the file:

```bash
rm ~/jxcryptwatcher/cryptos.json
```

It will be re-created on the next app launch.

## üß© Notes

- Internet connection is required to fetch live data from CoinMarketCap.
- CoinMarketCap enforces rate limits on API requests. To avoid exceeding these limits, please configure a minimum delay of 60 seconds between each API call. Being considerate with request frequency helps ensure stable access and prevents temporary bans.
